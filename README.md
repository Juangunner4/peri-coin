# $PERI MemeCoin UI

This repository contains the front‑end for the $PERI memecoin landing pages.
It currently showcases the token, allows users to explore information about
the project, and provides placeholders for upcoming features.

The UI is built with a mix of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components
and [Material UI](https://mui.com/) widgets for quick styling and accessibility.

## Planned Features

- **Meme Coin Generator** – users will be able to generate custom names and art
  for their own coins. The generator component is stubbed in `MemeGenerator.js`
  and can later be extended with libraries like `canvas` or server side APIs.
- **Manga NFT Minting** – the Manga page includes a simple mint UI. Future work
  will integrate a minting contract and display minted chapters to readers.
- **Mini Game** – the Game page now displays an under construction icon. A game
  or other interactive experience can be mounted here once development resumes.

Development uses `create-react-app` with custom overrides. Below are the
standard scripts from CRA.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
